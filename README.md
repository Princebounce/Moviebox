## Features

1. **Homepage**: The homepage displays the top 10 movies in a grid layout with movie posters. Each movie card includes the movie title and release date.

2. **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies by title. Search results are displayed with movie posters, titles, and release dates. A loading indicator is shown while fetching search results.

3. **Movie Details**: When users visit the `/movies/:id` route, they can view detailed information about a specific movie, including the title, release date (in UTC), runtime (in minutes), and an overview.

4. **API Integration**: The application consumes the TMDB API to fetch movie data, making use of the following API endpoints:
   - Fetch movie details by ID: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}`

5. **Error Handling**: The application implements error handling to display meaningful error messages to users in case of API failures or other issues.
